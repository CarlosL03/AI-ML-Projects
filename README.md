CS-450: Intro to AI
SDSU, Fall 2023

This repository includes my submitted AI project involving three datasets: Titanic passenger information, 
California housing information, and wines information. I explore each dataset using different visualization
techniques including different graphs like histograms, bar plots, scatter plots and more by making use of
seaborn and matplotlib libraries. A logistic regression model is performed on the Titanic dataset to predict
survival rate of passengers and a k-means clustering model is fit onto the wine dataset to cluster wines using
unsupervised learning.
